Monkey Jack is a funky mamma' jamma'<br />
He walks down the street with a whistle and a hammer<br />
He has two rings around his eyes<br />
When they ask him why, he says _It's my disguise_

Monkey Jack has a magic air balloon<br />
On the weekend he takes it to the moon<br />
Ask him nicely and he'll give you a ride<br />
But don't look down or else you might see inside

Don't talk smack about Monkey Jack<br />
Take it back or you'll get the sack<br />
There's no bank vault he can't crack<br />
His charming smile is his attack

Monkey Jack knows a German alligator<br />
When they leave for work they say, _Bis sp√§ter!_<br />
They have connections to the underground<br />
They're the lowest high roller in this town

Don't talk smack about Monkey Jack<br />
Take it back or you'll get the sack<br />
There's no bank vault he can't crack<br />
His charming smile is his attack

Monkey Jack's secret, he'll never tell<br />
About the man who slipped and fell,<br />
It doesn't matter how sorry you feel,<br />
When one perishes from your banana peel,<br />
Just a simple, quick, and thoughtless act,<br />
Now he has to run and never look back,<br />
Always wondering if life will get him back <br />
This is the tale of Monkey Jack

Don't talk smack about Monkey Jack<br />
Take it back or you'll get the sack<br />
There's no bank vault he can't crack<br />
His charming smile is his attack
