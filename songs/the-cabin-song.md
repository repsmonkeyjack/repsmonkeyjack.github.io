A million questions asked<br />
Trying to figure out the past<br />
Where did things go wrong<br />
A million signs before my eyes<br />
But it still took me by surprise<br />
After so long<br />
I am sorry for what I have to do<br />
You won't believe me but it's true

We gave it everything we got <br />
Was it really all for naught?<br />
Guess we had a good run<br />
Though it's tearing me apart<br />
I can feel it in my heart<br />
That it must be done<br />
I am sorry for what I have to do<br />
You won't believe me but it's true

I know someday you'll look back on this and say<br />
Guess it's better after all that things turned out this way<br />
I know you'll find somebody good for you who'll make things work<br />
But for now<br />
Still just feel like a goddamn jerk

It's only when you're looking back<br />
You can see after the fact<br />
How it should have been done<br />
After every bridge I’ve burned<br />
After everything I’ve learned<br />
I still feel so dumb<br />
I am sorry for what I have to do<br />
You won't believe me but it's true
