You ex-patriot<br />
How could you walk away?<br />
Where are you gonna stay?<br />
Where did you go astray?<br />

Memories<br />
how did you choose which to keep<br />
which will you take when you leave  <br />
no-one said it was easy<br />

But it's so easy<br />
I'm caught in the moment<br />
When I'm leaving it's a cold day without me<br />
It's so easy<br />
I'm caught in the moment<br />
It's a new day and a new place for me<br />

but if I fall, the song goes on without me<br />
and If I get tangled up, can I ever leave<br />
getting lost was one of my old hobbies<br />
and getting found,<br />

It's all so easy<br />
I'm caught in the moment<br />
When I'm leaving it's a cold day without me<br />
It's so easy<br />
I'm caught in the moment<br />
It's a new day and a new place for me<br />
