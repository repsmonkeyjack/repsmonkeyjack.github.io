So many words kept inside<br />
all the moments you missed<br />
heartless talk, useless fights<br />
conquer your mind.<br />
Heavy self-reproach tears<br />
you down to the ground -<br />
over and over.<br />
You're still mourning the past<br />
can't forgive your mistakes,<br />
set a trap for yourself and wonder how you got here.<br />
The walls are taking all the light!<br />

Time flies by<br />
You can't make it stop,<br />
so you better rush and don't wait<br />
Go, embrace the chances you got<br />
before it's too late<br />
Time flies by<br />
You can't make it stop,<br />
so you better rush and don't wait<br />
Go, embrace the chances you got till it's over<br />
Don't be afraid!<br />

Are you afraid to move on?<br />
You got used to being stuck.<br />
All the same rusty chains;<br />
you got the key.<br />
Opportunities fade,<br />
inner pressure still grows.<br />
You're cold and paralyzed.<br />
Hurry up, make a choice<br />
and get out of this cave<br />
Take a stand, open up,<br />
overcome your lethargy<br />
The well is filling up inside<br />

Time flies by<br />
You can't make it stop,<br />
so you better rush and don't wait<br />
Go, embrace the chances you got
before it's too late<br />
Time flies by<br />
You can't make it stop,<br />
so you better rush and don't wait<br />
Go, embrace the chances you got<br />
before itâ€™s too late<br />
