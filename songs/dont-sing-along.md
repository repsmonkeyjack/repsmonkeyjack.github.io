Can't stop the world from spinning<br />
Can't stop the birds from singing<br />
Sunlight is filling the room<br />
Can't stop it from shining through now<br />
I'm trying to walk down the street<br />
Can't even pick up my feet<br />
Just need to get across town<br />
Just need to keep this all down now

Do you remember<br />
What the hell went down last night?<br />
Cause I don't remember<br />
Maybe you can shed some light?

I was hiding under the table<br />
Stayed there as long I was able<br />
Just wanted one moment's peace<br />
Can you please just let me be me? Now<br />
They hunted me down<br />
Held my arms to the ground<br />
Made me drink 'til I drowned<br />
Cut my hair and broke my crown and

They tried to tell me<br />
That I couldn't sing along<br />
But it feels so right right now<br />
I don't understand why it's wrong

I just wanted to dance<br />
I just wanted to sing along to all my favorite songs<br />
And get lost in the rhythm<br />
But there was a cost <br />
And now I have to face the music<br />
I have to answer for myself<br />
And they all want the truth<br />
Everybody wants to know <br />
What did Bree do?

Even if you love the song<br />
You better not sing along<br />
If you feel it in your pants<br />
Don't even dare to dance

You're driving me crazy<br />
With these rules for your game<br />
I just wanna dance right now<br />
Feel like I'm in restraints

I just wanted to dance<br />
I just wanted to sing along to all my favorite songs<br />
And get lost in the rhythm<br />
But there was a cost<br />
And now I have to face the music<br />
I have to answer for myself<br />
And they all want the truth<br />
Everybody wants to know<br />
What did Bree do?
